  - In case a book can't be found on OpenLibrary check elsewhere 
- Let the output be editable
  - In case of error it's easily fixable 
  - Dump output into a textbox?
- Copy to clipboard button
- Make it pretty and stuffs
  - Also add appropriate message should a reference(s) not be found
  - Should a request result in multiple possible references â€” allow the person to choose. 
- Make a Chrome extension?
- Start searching for book as it's being entered (in the background)?
  - Cache results?
